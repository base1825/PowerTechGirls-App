EMPOWERING THE NATIONS
Project Overview
This mobile application was developed for a local small-to-medium enterprise (SME) initiative founded by Precious Radebe, whose goal is to empower members of her community through skills development and vocational training.

The SME offers practical courses designed to upskill domestic workers and gardeners, helping them become more employable and better compensated for their work. By gaining additional skills, trainees are also equipped to start their own small businesses, promoting entrepreneurship and self-sustainability within local communities.

The Empowering the Nation mobile app supports this vision by providing a digital platform through which:

Potential learners and employers can explore available training courses,

Users can receive quotations for selected services or training packages, and

The enterprise can promote its offerings to a broader audience beyond the immediate community.

This project demonstrates how mobile technology can be applied to address socioeconomic challenges by bridging the gap between education, employment, and digital accessibility.
